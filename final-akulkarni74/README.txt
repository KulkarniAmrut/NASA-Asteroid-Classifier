To Run My Code, simply run

    python3 experiments.py

    the dataset is included in the 'data' folder included in the submission

Dependencies:

    Make sure to have sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib installed on the machine you're runnig my code on


Note: Since I'm using GridSearchCV to get my optimal hyperparameters, there are times where the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest and Neural Net will change, but this does not affect their performance in any noticable way

Dataset:

    I used that NASA Asteroid classification dataset, which I have included with my submission

    If there is any issue with the file I have submitted, the linke for my dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification
